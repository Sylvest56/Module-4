# Module-4
This repository contains a JavaScript code snippet that demonstrates a simple greeting script. When executed, the script iterates through a list of names and decides whether to print "Hello" or "Good Bye" based on the first letter of each name. The script showcases basic JavaScript programming concepts, including loops, conditionals, and console output.
Feel free to explore the code to learn more about how it works and experiment with different names to see how the greetings change.
